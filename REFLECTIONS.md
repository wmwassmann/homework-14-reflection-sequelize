# Homework 14/ Reflection and Sequelize

## Part 1: Reflection


### The Journey so Far
1. What have you learned so far?
    - I grew up struggling to read. I never said anything to my parents because I was embarrassed.  I always made excuses and told them I just didn't get it.  I would even try to convince myself that I was just a below average child. My parents always told me otherwise, which - thank you mom and dad, but it wasn't until I was about 16 when I discovered dyslexia. Shortly after, we learned that I had ADHD, and likely a few other learning disorders, and this discouraged my teenage self from trying to do anything but physical and emotional work such as acting, blue collar work, etc. I convinced myself, I could not do desk job work because I could not read.  Even cold reading in acting was torture.  

    - This class has taught me something very important, if I have learned anything - it's that while I struggled, got way behind, did some things I wasn't proud of, and even now am on the brink of my deadline as I write this reflection - I can do this. My eyes aren't broken, they are just different.  I learned to see code in a different way. To take a mental image of the page and try and process it as a whole rather than line by line. To try and understand the full function rather than each individual slice. I used to try to read books and would get stuck looping a single paragraph three or four times before I even slighttly understood what what being covered, and that discouraged me from ever doing anything regarding using my eyes in a way to read text. And yet, here I am. Confident, driven to keep learning, and ready to apply my physical work ethic to my mental one. It will be hard, but that's life.  

2. What have you accomplished?
    - A lot. I wanted to do this homework last becuase I think it needs to be a full reflection. I learned how to make my own website, and while even though some of my homeworks are a bit sloppy - or rather very sloppy, I actually LOVE to code. I never thought I'd say that.  It's a puzzle that my brain was desperately yearning for.  I watch coding videos in my spare time now - this is nothing like the old me.  I used to just play video games as soon as I got out of bed and now I watch Web Dev Simplified while I drink my morning coffee.  
    - The accomplishment here is, I let myself be reprogrammed for my 30s. I'm 29 as of this date 12/11, but on 12/27, I'm no longer in my 20s. I want to get out of the blue collar mindset and start making a solid living, buy a house, have a family.  I can't do those things working as a server and a restaurant or a tire guy. 
    - Regardless of how I got here, I am proud of the fact that I kept going, even when things got absolutely terrible for me in August and September, and when I let myself get a million homeworks behind and resorted to some unfavorable tactics. It doesn't matter. This is not the end.  

3. Think back to the first week, how have you changed and grown since then?

    - Week one I was terrified. I thought that I was in way over my head and almost dropped in the first week.  But what made me stick it out was the promise I made to myself in 2018. "I will never live in poverty again.  I will never have a single $1 bill to my name again (It happened once) and I will break all of my bad habits." Running from success was one of my worst habits.  Giving up too soon, or when it's "in the bag." So it was a promise to myself that got me through that.  And the rest is a struggle, but it's a good one. 

### Path to Success
1. What are your goals for the remainder of the course? (Remainder of your fullstack career)
    - User experience is one of my personal favorite aspects of this job.  I love understand how the user will see the application, how they will react to the different interfaces, features, and overall functionality, as well as - "How close to our promise did we come?", "Did the buyer get what they paid for?" These are the most important aspects of development in my eyes. Customer satisfaction. So I will be pushing myself to crisp up all of my more "professional" homeworks over the next few weeks making them look better, react better to the user inputs, and feel simpler to use. 
2. What do you hope to accomplish before the course completes?
    - The course is more or less over - but I feel I've accomplished all that I can given the constraints.  
3. What do you hope to accomplish after the course completes?
    - I would like to continue working with my DnDbuddies, and try to push out RGA: Adventurer's Academy version 4.0. And then start building relationships with industry professionals.  I would like to see if we can work with Wizards of the Coast, and beyond. 
    - Work in the industry, hopefully in UX or UI.  But I'll take just about anything. 
4. What strategies will you employ to ensure you accomplish these goals?
    - Keep working, keep learning. Just because the course is done does not mean I can stop learning.  I cannot stop learning. 
5. How do these plans and goals differ from the first half of the course?
    - They don't.  This has been my mindset from the start.  Do not stop. Even though I did for a little while and I let myself fall behind, I picked myself up, told myself - "I can do this," and did it.
